       <p>Ernesto "Che" Guevara de la Serna was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary who was a prominent figure during the Cuban Revolution. Guevara studied medicine before traveling around South America, observing the conditions that spurred his Marxist beliefs. He aided Fidel Castro in overturning the Batista government during the late 1950s, and then held key political offices during Castro's regime. Guevara later engaged in guerrilla action elsewhere, including in Bolivia, where he was captured and executed in 1967.Early Life</p>
